# [Part 1: Smart Contracting with Python](https://blog.lamden.io/smart-contracting-with-python-2af233620dca)
Create a token smart contract from scratch using Python's Contracting package. The simple smart contract will mint
an initial supply to a user of our choice and then define a tansfer method for our users to use. To finish it off we
create unit test to validate our new smart contact does exactly what we want it to do.

# [Part 2: Python Smart Contract Dev Server](https://blog.lamden.io/python-smart-contract-dev-server-f81bd605a92c)
Expanding on the smart contract from Part 1 we create a python dev server that allows us to make mock transactions
against our smart contract and query the state. This part also covers the basis of how smart contract information is
stored on the blockchain.

# [Part 3a: A Frontend for your Smart Contract](https://blog.lamden.io/a-frontend-for-your-smart-contract-29381108a5d5)
We add some interactivity to our smart contract by installing Sapper to create a dApp that allows us to interact with
the smart contract for login and displaying token balances.

# [Part 3b: A Frontend for your Smart Contract](https://blog.lamden.io/a-frontend-for-your-smart-contract-part-b-e28a11dbdd8e)
We continue to build out our dApp by creating a transfer from to allow our users to send tokens to each other.
